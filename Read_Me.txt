Welcome to the Project Folder.

- The Combined group presentation powerpoint is titled "PL 18/19 - The Neck to Neck Race".

- The SQL Tables folder contains all the data tables exported directly from MySQL Workbench. A SQL script file detailing the creation of the schema and table definitions is inside as well.

- Each positional analysis, SQL queries, stories, and Tableau files are in seperate folders with their respective names. Please note that Stavan did not connect to his local SQL server. He instead exported his SQL query results, compiled his exports into an excel and uploaded to Tableau.
